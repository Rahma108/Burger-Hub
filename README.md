üçî Burger Website

This project is a simple Burger Menu Page built using HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and JSON Server for the backend.

The website displays a list of burger products (name + price) that are fetched dynamically from the backend API. The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

The backend is powered by JSON Server, which provides a fake REST API. All the product data is stored in a db.json file and fetched using the Fetch API in JavaScript.

The project demonstrates how to connect a frontend (HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JS) with a simple backend (JSON Server) in order to build a dynamic and interactive menu page.

This structure makes it easy to extend the project in the future by adding features like a shopping cart, product details, or connecting it to a real database.
